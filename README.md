## To-do
### 7/8
1. try different regularization parameter (lambda) 
2. try adding more ordered quadruples (closer to full order)
3. try doing comparing the gram matrix (K and K_) directly instead of the decomposed positions (X and X_)
4. try problem with different data  
  i) more interesting generated data (s fold, swiss roll, etc)  
  ii) simple real world data
